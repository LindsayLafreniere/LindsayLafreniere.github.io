            <p>SaaS tools have revolutionized how businesses and individuals access software applications, with their ease of use, scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. Simply put: They’re powerful productivity drivers. But the reality of having a distributed workforce with access to thousands of apps at their fingertips is also causing a staggering growth of "SaaS sprawl" and Shadow IT. As SaaS proliferates across enterprises with the rise of hybrid work, it’s important to be aware of the risks and manage accordingly. Here we provide our best advice on modern SaaS management.</p>

            <h2>Are You Suffering from SaaS Sprawl?</h2>
            <p>“SaaS sprawl” refers to the uncontrolled and unchecked use of SaaS applications spreading through many organizations. The problem is growing. According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com" target="_blank">Gartner</a>, worldwide spending on SaaS tools is expected to reach $243 billion in 2023. Large enterprises are <a href="https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/stats/saas-statistics.html" target="_blank">reported</a> to use around 254 different SaaS applications on average, while smaller businesses also have substantial usage. More than half of SaaS licenses are not used regularly, leading to issues such as budget waste and security threats.</p>
            <p>Other <a href="https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/stats/saas-statistics.html" target="_blank">studies</a> indicate organizations failing to manage their SaaS portfolios effectively are likely to overspend by at least 25% due to incorrect entitlements and overlapping tools. This unmanaged growth poses financial, security, and operational risks.</p>

            <h2>How SaaS Addresses Your Business Needs</h2>
            <p>SaaS has taken the headache out of some of the issues with conventional software. Traditionally, software was sold at an upfront cost with ongoing support fees. Usually, it was a perpetual license – where the owner had the right to use the software indefinitely.</p>
            <p>SaaS providers use a subscription model, generally a monthly or annual fee. Prices are competitive with on-premises software. Many apps offer a freemium version, which gives free service with limited functionalities. Subscription plans can easily be scaled up or down to accommodate changing business needs.</p>
            <p>These apps can be installed and deployed almost instantaneously, without the need for traditional partners or intermediaries. SaaS apps are delivered over the internet, eliminating the need for complex installations and updates. They are also generally updated more frequently than non-SaaS software, meaning users have access to the latest features and security improvements.</p>

            <h2>The Risks that Come with SaaS Sprawl</h2>
            <p>Despite the many advantages of using SaaS over traditional software, there are plenty of risks. In addition to excessive amounts of SaaS tools being downloaded at the enterprise level, many business units are purchasing their own subscriptions or downloading freemium tools without IT’s oversight. These unregulated SaaS budgets can quickly grow out of control.</p>
            <p>SaaS subscriptions and log-ins also expand the security risk surface. The more SaaS providers used, the more subdomains and APIs are generated to maintain integrations. Your business is as protected from threats as the weakest SaaS provider you are using.</p>
            <p>SaaS providers are prone to data breaches, including with the use of single sign-on (SSO). Okta, a SSO provider, saw a series of security breaches last October after what they believe was one of their employees signing into their personal Google account on a company-owned device.</p>
            <p>With more SaaS tools being used there is also a greater opportunity for users to work in silos. For example, using a variety of project management tools can create fragmentation and hinder productivity.</p>

            <h2>How to Take Control of Enterprise SaaS Use</h2>
            <p><strong>1. Create a Single Source of Truth and Simplify Subscriptions</strong><br>
            It all starts with knowing what you have and what you’re using. Create a centralized database to get a clear picture of SaaS products being used or subscribed to. Look for ways to cut waste and simplify apps. For example, you shouldn’t pay for Webex if you have Microsoft Teams.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Establish Policies and Communications</strong><br>
            Establish clear policies and communicate them to employees. Develop guidelines, identify approved vendors, and blacklist unsafe apps. Provide internal communications and encourage strong passwords and two-factor authentication.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Monitor SaaS Subscriptions and Usage</strong><br>
            Continue to monitor SaaS usage monthly with centralized tools. Track logins, identify overlap, and cancel unnecessary subscriptions. Monitor unauthorized apps and remediate overlap.</p>
