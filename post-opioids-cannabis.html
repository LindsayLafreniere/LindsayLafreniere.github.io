The opioid epidemic continues to worsen, with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting 81,000 overdose deaths from 2019 to 2020. Meanwhile, 19 American states have legalized recreational cannabis. Could cannabis be used as a substitute for opioids or help lessen the harms? 

Cannabis legalization linked to decline in opioid-related emergency department visits

A recent study led by the University of Pittsburgh found that when recreational cannabis is legalized in a state, there was a short-term decline in opioid-related emergency department visits. People may use cannabis to manage pain and relieve opioid withdrawal symptoms, but it doesn’t directly treat opioid use disorder, write the authors.

The researchers found a 7.6 percent reduction in emergency visits in the four states studied that have implemented cannabis legalization: California, Maine, Massachusetts, and Nevada. Twenty-five additional states acted as controls. The reduction was seen mainly in adults aged 25 to 44, and in more men than other people.

This decline was only seen for six months after legalization, though, which may suggest there is not a long-term replacement. But researchers are positive that this is good news for policymakers, stating that opioid use could be decreased with recreational cannabis laws. 

“We suspect that people who use opioids for pain relief are substituting with cannabis, at least temporarily,” said lead author Coleman Drake, Ph.D., in a press release. “Cannabis can provide pain relief for persons using opioids, but cannabis ultimately is not a treatment for opioid use disorder.”

Medical cannabis could reduce prescription opioid use

Cannabis may reduce the use of prescription opioids and improve quality of life, found Canadian research published in the journal of Pain Medicine. The study included 1145 medical cannabis patients at 21 clinics across Canada. Participants were 57.6 percent female, with an average age of 52 years. 

After six months, there was a 78 percent reduction in opioid dosages used. Similar reductions were seen in four other types of prescription drugs being taken by participants. 

In addition to lower use of opioids and prescription drugs for chronic pain, participants also reported an improvement in quality of life. The authors suggest that cannabis may play a harm-reduction role in the opioid overdose crisis and potentially improve public health. 

Those with opioid use disorder may increase use when consuming cannabis

While cannabis may be used as a substitute for prescription opioids, research has also looked at the use of both by adults with problem substance use. Research published in the journal Addiction found that opioid use approximately doubled on days when cannabis was also used. 

The paper studied adults in the greater New York area that were defined as having problem substance use. They used non-medical opioids, ie, street drugs such as heroin, and may also use medical opioids more than prescribed or without a prescription. 

“Substitution of non-medical opioids with cannabis was unlikely, regardless of the presence of significant pain, results that applied equally to men and women and across OUD [opioid use disorder] severity levels,” wrote the authors. 

Research developing around the use of cannabis as a replacement for opioids

The direct links between cannabis and opioid use are still unclear. But there is promising research around the use of cannabis to replace some prescription opioids to treat pain. Initial cannabis legalization has been connected to a decrease in emergency department visits. Cannabis has been shown in some studies to be used in the replacement of opioids, but this may not be the case for those with problem substance use or opioid use disorder.

          
            <p>When <a href="http://www.bethfrey.com/about/" target="_blank" adhocenable="false">Beth Frey</a>, GrDip 09, MFA 15, started experimenting with AI art and posting it on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bethisms" target="_blank" adhocenable="false">Instagram</a>, she thought of it as just a “weird little hobby.”<a adhocenable="false" href="/academics/graduate/communication-studies-diploma.html"></a></p>
            <p>“But about two months in, it went viral,” says Frey. “It started getting attention from all sorts of people, including in the film and music industries.”</p>
            <p>The British Columbia native divides her time between Montreal and Mexico City, where she rents out a studio in a high school. Frey is a visual artist who works primarily with watercolour and in video performance. But her multidisciplinary practice found a new tool when she discovered an older AI image generator called VQGAN+CLIP.</p>
            <p>“I like to have new toys and tools to play with,” says Frey, who earned a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/communication-studies-diploma.html">Graduate Diploma in Communication Studies</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="/academics/graduate/studio-arts-mfa.html">MFA in Studio Arts</a>&nbsp;at Concordia.&nbsp;</p>
          </div>

          <div class="text">
            <p>“I was kind of jealous of the AI at first,” she admits. “It’s doing this thing that we want to do as painters. But I was really amazed at how it created images that were a mix of figurative and abstract.”</p>
            <p>Frey soon created a second Instagram account, called <a adhocenable="false" href="https://www.instagram.com/sentientmuppetfactory/?hl=es" target="_blank">@sentientmuppetfactory</a>, devoted to new works enabled by AI tools like DALL-E 2. The account quickly ballooned to more than 100,000 followers, with Sam Smith, Cat Power, Darren Aronofsky, Noel Fielding, actress-comedian Patti Harrison and fellow artists like Daniel Popper and Ketnipz among them.</p>
            <p>“It's been surreal gaining the attention of artists and musicians I respect,” says Frey. “As a working artist, that's sort of a dream, but when it’s for a side project that I started on a lark, it's a bit strange. I’ve enjoyed the attention, but I did feel a bit of a pressure to keep going with it rather than commit to the practice I’d been focusing on for years.”</p>
            <h3><b>‘Wanting to toe this line between the beautiful and grotesque’</b></h3>
            <p>Body distortion, her own included, is an important part of Frey’s work (she refers to it as “light body horror”). When a friend asked if her watercolour and video images were self-portraits, it was revelatory.</p>
            <p>“Even if they’re not literally depicting me, there’s a lot of myself in them, and this sense of awkwardness of having a body in society,” Frey observes. “A lot of my work is wanting to toe this line between the beautiful and grotesque.”</p>

            <p>With AI, Frey can experiment with imaginary concepts — like, for example, a woman dressed as an inflatable nostril. She then further manipulates the image with prompts.</p>
            <p>While useful, working with AI can also be stressful and not without concerns, says Frey.</p>
            <p>“Just because I play with AI in my art, it doesn’t mean I’m 100 per cent behind AI doing everything. There’s a lot that I’m really terrified of.”</p>
            <p>Frey recently completed a residency at Stewart Hall Art Gallery in Pointe-Claire, Montreal. An installation of her watercolours and video work is part of a group exhibition, called <i>Offstage</i>, that examines the relationship between theatre and visual art.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The challenge of how to incorporate and work with AI continues to be a part of her creative practice. She finds AI commissions difficult, because some of her best results come from randomness and unpredictability. But she is open to working on future projects that are creatively stimulating and that she can add her voice to.</p>
            <p>“I'm still trying to figure out what my relationship is to AI,” she says. “It’s advanced a lot and the internet seems to be saturated with AI-generated imagery, and I’m not sure if it's the thing I want to attach myself to as an artistic identity. That said, as long as it offers an interesting tool to work with creatively, I'm happy to continue exploring it.”</p>
