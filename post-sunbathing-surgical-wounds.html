    <p>When <a href="http://www.bethfrey.com/about/" target="_blank" adhocenable="false">Beth Frey</a>, GrDip 09, MFA 15, started experimenting with AI art and posting it on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bethisms" target="_blank" adhocenable="false">Instagram</a>, she thought of it as just a “weird little hobby.”<a adhocenable="false" href="/academics/graduate/communication-studies-diploma.html"></a></p>
<p>“But about two months in, it went viral,” says Frey. “It started getting attention from all sorts of people, including in the film and music industries.”</p>
<p>The British Columbia native divides her time between Montreal and Mexico City, where she rents out a studio in a high school. Frey is a visual artist who works primarily with watercolour and in video performance. But her multidisciplinary practice found a new tool when she discovered an older AI image generator called VQGAN+CLIP.</p>
<p>“I like to have new toys and tools to play with,” says Frey, who earned a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/communication-studies-diploma.html">Graduate Diploma in Communication Studies</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="/academics/graduate/studio-arts-mfa.html">MFA in Studio Arts</a>&nbsp;at Concordia.&nbsp;</p>

        <div class="text"><p>“I was kind of jealous of the AI at first,” she admits. “It’s doing this thing that we want to do as painters. But I was really amazed at how it created images that were a mix of figurative and abstract.”</p>
<p>Frey soon created a second Instagram account, called <a adhocenable="false" href="https://www.instagram.com/sentientmuppetfactory/?hl=es" target="_blank">@sentientmuppetfactory</a>, devoted to new works enabled by AI tools like DALL-E 2. The account quickly ballooned to more than 100,000 followers, with Sam Smith, Cat Power, Darren Aronofsky, Noel Fielding, actress-comedian Patti Harrison and fellow artists like Daniel Popper and Ketnipz among them.</p>
<p>“It's been surreal gaining the attention of artists and musicians I respect,” says Frey. “As a working artist, that's sort of a dream, but when it’s for a side project that I started on a lark, it's a bit strange. I’ve enjoyed the attention, but I did feel a bit of a pressure to keep going with it rather than commit to the practice I’d been focusing on for years.”</p>
<h3><b>‘Wanting to toe this line between the beautiful and grotesque’</b></h3>
<p>Body distortion, her own included, is an important part of Frey’s work (she refers to it as “light body horror”). When a friend asked if her watercolour and video images were self-portraits, it was revelatory.</p>
<p>“Even if they’re not literally depicting me, there’s a lot of myself in them, and this sense of awkwardness of having a body in society,” Frey observes. “A lot of my work is wanting to toe this line between the beautiful and grotesque.”</p>

<p>Frey recently completed a residency at Stewart Hall Art Gallery in Pointe-Claire, Montreal. An installation of her watercolours and video work is part of a group exhibition, called <i>Offstage</i>, that examines the relationship between theatre and visual art.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge of how to incorporate and work with AI continues to be a part of her creative practice.

<p>“I'm still trying to figure out what my relationship is to AI,” she says. “It’s advanced a lot and the internet seems to be saturated with AI-generated imagery, and I’m not sure if it's the thing I want to attach myself to as an artistic identity. That said, as long as it offers an interesting tool to work with creatively, I'm happy to continue exploring it.”</p>
