            <p>"Hadaka no tsukiai" is the Japanese phrase for "naked companionship," the bonding that occurs in public baths. In the nude, there is nothing to hide and status means nothing; onsen, or hot springs, may be the most relaxed and uninhibited places in Japan. And here I was baring it all. To a monkey.</p>

            <p>The directions to Korakukan ryokan, a rustic inn in the mountains, read like a scene in a Haruki Murakami novel – take the train to Nagano, a bus and then walk two kilometres through the forest. It gets dark quickly. There may be monkeys on the path. Do not look into the monkey's eyes.</p>

            <p>Thankfully, we arrived in full daylight but not after slipping and sliding along the snowy path, wearing cheap boots bought on a Tokyo street.</p>

            <p>The inn has segregated baths, but the star attraction is the outdoor, stone hot spring, located next to the river and a surging geyser. Here, everyone is welcome, including the snow monkeys who venture over from Jigokudani, the nearby park.</p>

            <p>The animals are an anomaly – supposedly the only monkeys that take hot baths in the world. Since the solemn, hot-spring soaking monkey appeared on the cover of <em>Life</em> in 1970, Japanese macaques have held many imaginations. It's their eerie human-like expressions. Sliding into the hot water, eyes closed and mouth gasping, they look just like a Canadian immersing themselves into the hot tub after a rough day on the slopes.</p>

            <p>But do I really want to get naked in a hot spring with a monkey?</p>

            <p>Wearing only a small, flimsy towel, I stumble outside onto the snowy path of the hot spring. An icy gust of wind blows past, but the coast is clear. I shuffle along in Japanese slippers when, turning a corner, I shriek at the large mound of fur in front of me.</p>

            <p>I had read that an occasional snow monkey might come by, but not heaps of them huddled together and dozing. One regal-looking primate sits right in the spring that I want to enjoy. Its disinterested glance seems to indicate that it's okay to join him. So I do. But as I slip in, it occurs to me that this is a vulnerable position to be in: naked, in water, with an animal that could attack at any moment.</p>

            <p>Perhaps it was the mountain scenery or the hot, medicinal water working its magic, but soon I was completely relaxed.</p>

            <p>My human company began to increase. Two timid young men, holding their towels carefully, looked more concerned with the naked foreigners than with the animals in the bath. Next came a family with three young children. Soon, everyone was cooing at the monkeys, taking each other's photos and exchanging simple Japanese and English phrases, completely at ease.</p>

            <p>Different ages, genders, nationalities and even species sharing the same hot spring. I may never find this type of naked companionship again.</p>
