   <p>New to podcasting or wondering what the rich and famous are up to lately? Maybe you’re a veteran podcaster and wondering what shows are popular now. Well, celebrity podcasts are hot. There seems to have been an explosion lately, with everyone from big-name celebrities, like Oprah and Kate Hudson, to old favorites, such as Jason Bateman and Dana Carvey, now recording their own shows. </p><p>The thing is, not every podcast is going to be great because it has a celebrity hosting it. The best celebrity podcasts have personable hosts, interesting guests, engaging topics, and regularly release episodes. In this guide, we’ll recommend 25 of the best celebrity podcasts in 2024. Get your headphones out! </p></div><div fs-richtext-element="rich-text" class="blog-richtext w-richtext"><div class="w-embed"><div></div></div><h2>What celebrities have podcasts?</h2><p>While it may seem like <em>everyone</em> has a podcast nowadays, the reality is that few A-list celebrities have podcasts that are regularly putting out new content. It takes a lot of time and effort to make a podcast that is releasing consistently, so many celebrities will make limited-run series or just podcast for a year or two. </p><p>Some of the best celebrity podcasts of 2024 feature actors and comedians that were likely more famous in the past and now have ventured into podcasting to share their stories and love for entertainment. There’s also a large group of new comedians and actors now podcasting which makes sense as they are naturally entertaining and good talkers. </p><p>Here we review 25 of the best celebrity podcasts being released in 2024. </p><div class="w-embed"><div></div></div><h2>25 Best celebrity podcasts in 2025</h2><h3>1.

As seen above, these podcasts cover a range of different subjects, from more serious topics to just pure laughs. If you’re especially interested in television and movie production, fame and celebrity, we recommend the Smartless podcast as it features three celebrity hosts and many famous guests.</p><div class="w-embed"><div></div></div><h2>Do celebrities make money on podcasts?</h2><p>While podcasts can be huge money-making enterprises, recognize that these are in a very small minority of the number of ones currently being released.</p><p>The biggest deal to date has been Spotify’s purchase of the exclusive rights to The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which they reportedly paid <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/spotify-said-to-have-paid-200million-for-joe-rogan-podcast-deal-twice-the-figure-previously-reported-3164283" target="_blank">up to $200 million</a> for. Other high earners are the podcast My Favorite Murder, making over $15 million USD a year, the Dave Ramsey Show, at $10 million, and Armchair Expert, at $9 million yearly. </p><p>Large podcast deals, such as with Spotify and other networks, as well as advertising, is where the bulk of the money comes from. But podcasters will also offer sponsored and exclusive content, merchandise, live events, consulting services, as well as crowdfund money through platforms like Patreon. </p><blockquote><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://riverside.com/blog/how-much-do-podcasters-make"><strong>How Much Do Podcasters Make?</strong></a></blockquote><div class="w-embed"><div></div></div><h2>FAQs on Celebrity Podcasts</h2><h3>What famous people have podcasts on Spotify?</h3><p>Spotify has <a href="https://www.quillpodcasting.com/blog-posts/spotify-podcasts" target="_blank">signed massive partnerships</a> with celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Michelle Obama, Prince Harry, and Meghan Markle, as well as researcher and lecturer ​​Brené Brown. It’s been reported that Spotify is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/11/spotify-shuts-down-its-in-house-original-podcast-studio/" target="_blank">shutting down its in-house original podcast studio</a> known as Studio 4. But this is only one of many podcast studios they own and they continue to acquire more. </p><h3>Why does every celebrity have a podcast?</h3><p>Due to the time and effort required to consistently put out quality podcasts, it means that fewer celebrities than you think have podcasts. Actors that are working consistently likely don’t have the availability to do weekly recordings. Also, big-name celebrities may put out podcasts that don’t have content engaging enough for listeners. </p><p>Looking at the top charts, most podcasts are hosted by people that didn’t start out as celebrities. For example, the hosts of My Favorite Murder were working in the entertainment field but the podcast is what shot them to success. Many top charting podcasts are also being produced by news organizations like The New York Times podcast The Daily. </p><h3>Which reality stars have podcasts?</h3><p>Many reality television stars have ventured into podcasting, such as the cast of Jersey Shore with the podcast It’s Happening. RuPaul’s Drag Race stars have also created many entertaining podcasts, including Race Chaser with Alaska and Willam. Real Housewives stars have started their own pods, including Just B with Bethenny Frankel. </p><h3>Do the Kardashians have a podcast?</h3><p>Surprisingly, the Kardashian family had not yet ventured into podcasting until now. Kim recently released her new podcast with Spotify called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3jZDFVPg16bumJF1slc90L?si=61ad94bdeb7944a5&amp;nd=1&amp;utm_source=Hot+Pod&amp;utm_campaign=2e4cf7bc31-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_10_04_04_30&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f85dcd1354-2e4cf7bc31-92299113" target="_blank">Kim Kardashian’s The System: The Case of Kevin Keith</a>. There are also a number of podcasts about the family, their show and lives, and reality tv culture in general, including <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kar-dishin-it-all-things-kardashian/id1209287641" target="_blank">Kar Dishin’ It: All Things Kardashian</a>, and the Kardashian series on the podcasts <a href="https://wondery.com/shows/even-the-rich/" target="_blank">Even the Rich</a> and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/reality-tv-6-keeping-up-with-the-kardashian-empire/id1551181322?i=1000512363460" target="_blank">Spectacle: Reality TV</a>. </p><h3>How do podcasts get celebrities?</h3><p>It may be difficult to land a celebrity <a href="https://riverside.com/blog/podcast-interview-preparation" target="_blank">guest for your podcast</a>, but it’s not impossible if you’ve built a large listenership and narrowed your focus. Celebrities will want exposure from being a podcast guest, so you’ll need to create a big community of people listening in by consistently releasing quality episodes. If you also build a niche audience around a certain subject, you may be likely to book celebrities that are also interested in that field. </p><p>Research which celebrities are doing podcast interviews, likely when they have something to plug – like a new show or book. Starting locally in your region may also help with looking at which people may have fewer podcasts contacting them. Once you’ve narrowed down on a few people, find and contact their PR representative with a pitch including information and statistics on your podcasts, including reach. Basically, show them how the celebrity would benefit from being on the podcast. You may also luck out with a social media message sent directly to the celebrity. </p></div><div class="blog-richtext w-condition-invisible w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="blog-single-newsletter-box"><div class="blog-single-newsletter-box-content"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/685be7dcd32275d3830651d3/685be7dcd32275d383066b80_Mail.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-194"/><div class="single-blog-newsletter-title">Never miss another article</div><div class="blog-newsletter-description">Highly curated content, case studies, Riverside updates, and more.</div></div><div class="blog-banner-update-block-right"><div class="blog-banner-update-form w-form"><form id="wf-form-Blog-Subscribe-Form-2" name="wf-form-Blog-Subscribe-Form-2" data-name="Blog Subscribe Form" method="get" class="form" data-wf-page-id="685be7dcd32275d383065313" data-wf-element-id="9913021b-812f-0444-62e1-ceb7ee83d327"><input class="blog-banner-update-form-input-2 w-input" maxlength="256" name="email-2" data-name="Email 2" placeholder="Enter your email address" type="email" id="email-2" required=""/><input type="submit" data-wait="Please wait..." class="blog-banner-update-form-button w-button" value="Subscribe"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
