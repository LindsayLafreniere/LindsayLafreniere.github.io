		 <p> “No one took the Morrison family seriously
when they said that Tiffany was missing,” said
Kary Ann Deer of Projets Autochtones du
Québec. “They thought she was just a young
native woman, out getting drunk and slacking
on her responsibilities. All the police officers
said was ‘She’ll come back.’”</p>

<p>She hasn’t.</p>

<p>Gone for more than three years without any
leads, Tiffany Morrison is one of the 521 reported cases of missing or murdered Aboriginal
women in Canada over the past 30 years.</p>

<p>On Oct. 2, Deer spoke with other panellists at the Justice for Missing and Murdered
Indigenous Women discussion at Concordia
University’s de Sève Cinema. According to
Deer, Morrison’s case demonstrates the
indifferent attitudes shown to Aboriginal
women.</p>
<p>
Morrison was last seen in a taxi going home
to Kahnawake, Quebec from the LaSalle borough. Melanie Morrison, Tiffany’s sister, said
the family knew something was wrong, since
Tiffany had a young daughter at home and
would always phone when running late.</p>

<p>“There are three taxi companies that go to
Kahnawake,” said Melanie. “We had no information about the cab she took [since] the cabbies do not call in fares, so no one could tell us
who was working that night. The cabbies are
working illegally, so no one will come forward.” </p>

<p>Morrison recounted the complete frustration she had experienced with the lack of investigation by authorities. The Kahnawake
Peacekeepers police their community, but the
family also needed help from the Sûreté du
Québec, the RCMP and the LaSalle police,
since the disappearance was outside their
reserve. None of the other police forces were
willing to act or take the case seriously, she
said.</p>

<p>Craig Benjamin, a campaigner for
Indigenous people’s rights with Amnesty
International, spoke of the violence embedded
in society’s responses towards Aboriginal
women. He discussed how these women are
denied a sense of worth due to entrenched
stereotypes, leading men to deliberately target
them.</p>

<p>“There is public indifference towards the
safety and well-being of Aboriginal women in
Canada,” said Benjamin. “The marginalization of these women sets the context and
allows violence to be carried out, and then
there is inadequate justice.”</p>

<p>He also criticized the partial figure of the 521
missing or murdered women as this number is
compiled from family’s accounts and media
reporting. The government of Canada has no
verified account of these cases and Benjamin
estimates that only 60 per cent are known.</p>

<p>“The lives of Aboriginal women mean so little that their deaths are not even recorded,” he
continued.</p>

<p>Benjamin said there needs to be national
protocols for dealing with missing people. The
lack of current standards leads some police
officers to respond to a report on missing
Aboriginal women with their own biases, which
proves detrimental in finding the women.
In addition to the discussion, the National
Sisters in Spirit March and Vigil was held on
the evening of Oct. 4. Marchers walked down
Ste-Catherine Street, protesting the high number of missing Indigenous women and the lack
of government response.</p>

<p>“If 500 soldiers were killed in Afghanistan,
there would be an uproar,” said Yasmin Jiwani,
a communications associate professor at
Concordia. “Five hundred Aboriginal women
have disappeared or have been murdered in Canada and no ones cares." </p>
