        <h2>Lindsay Lafreniere</h2>

        <p>I’m Lindsay Lafreniere, a Canadian freelance writer and podcast producer living in Portugal — though my work and life have taken me everywhere from Thailand to Japan to Dubai.</p>

        <p>With a background in journalism, communications, and media production, I’ve spent over a decade working across sectors — including broadcasting, healthcare, housing, higher education, and podcasting.</p>

        <p>I’ve worked with organizations like <strong>CBC</strong>, <strong>The Walrus</strong>, <strong>Vancouver Coastal Health</strong>, <strong>UBC</strong>, and <strong>BC Housing</strong>, and my writing has appeared in outlets such as <em>The Globe and Mail</em>, <em>Live Science</em>, and <em>The Discoverer</em>.</p>

        <p>I have more than ten years of experience working in communications, journalism, and media relations, including in corporate, non-profit, government, hospital, and university environments. Following grad school, I worked for various media including broadcasting at CBC, and in documentary production and magazine publishing at The Walrus. I have also held positions in academic and government communications and corporate online marketing. Currently, I work full-time as a freelance podcast producer, writer, and editor.</p>

        <p>My experience includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Producing or contributing to eight podcasts across genres and platforms</li>
          <li>Leading COVID-19 communications at one of Canada’s largest hospitals (Vancouver General)</li>
          <li>Coordinating community consultations on social housing and homelessness across British Columbia</li>
          <li>Supporting international projects including the UN Ocean Conference in New York and conferences in Dubai and Osaka</li>
          <li>Creating content strategies, reports, graphics, and websites for clients in government, non-profits, health, and education, among others</li>
          <li>Writing and editing for print, web, and broadcast — from investigative journalism to branded storytelling</li>
        </ul>
